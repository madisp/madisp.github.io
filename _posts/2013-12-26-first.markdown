Holla! My name is Madis Pink, and I'm an Android developer based in Stockholm. I like to fiddle around with _weird_ side projects and I needed a way to document my findings and muse about things in general. Hence, o' visitor, I hope thee find this site useful. (And I hope I can keep this up even after the vacation).
