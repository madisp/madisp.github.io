Obligatory first meta-post about myself and this blog in general.

I'm an Estonian developer based in Stockholm and working mostly with Android. I like to fiddle
around with _weird_ side projects and I needed a way to document my findings and muse about things in general. Hence, o' visitor, I hope thee find this site useful.
